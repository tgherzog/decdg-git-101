* Fundamentals of version control and git
* Differences between git and GitHub
* Git workflow

???

* Here's a basic outline for the course
* We'll start just by going over some basic concepts of version control
  and what git is designed to do for people who aren't familiar with them
* We'll talk about the differences between git and GitHub
* Then talk about how people work with git and what the workflow is like,
  how to manage and monitor changes, work with teams, and so on

There are lots and lots of different tools for using git, from tools
that work via the command line to very visual ones to ones that are
integrated with other tools. This course shows how to use git in RStudio.
But we'll also show the command line equivalents for every feature.
Other tools will have different ways to accomplish most of the things
you'll learn here.
