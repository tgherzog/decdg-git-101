# Updating from a repository

Working with teams: `git fetch` and `git pull`
to get the latest commits from Github or TFS

Also mention the difference between local and remote branches

---

# Merging Changes

Use `git merge` to combine a branch into another one
or incorporate changes from a remote repo or from your team members

Walk through a three-way merge (i.e. potentially with conflicts)

---

# Pushing changes to Github or TFS #

Use `git push`

Also cover pull requests in Github (does RStudio provide support for these?)
